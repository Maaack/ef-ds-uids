# Ef Ds UIDs
For Godot 4.4+

Replaces UIDs from scenes, scripts, and Godot's cache.  

## Why?  

The errors are obnoxious, and the caching is awful.  

The editor doesn't even support fixing any of the warnings and errors it complains about.

So f\*\*\* these UIDs.  

## What?

Supports the following extensions:
- `tres`
- `tscn`
- `gd`

## How?  

Right-click on files in the File System Dock, and select `Replace UIDs`.
